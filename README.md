minBrowserReqs
==============

Minimum Browser Requirements detection

This is a javascript project to explicitly define a list of (in)compatible 
browsers for a website or web application. The selection can be done based 
on browser versions. Upon incompatibility detection, it is possible to 
customize the action to follow, such as redirection or a custom message.

### Usage

Use the minified version in the build directory and also the css file. Insert 
the code below in the head section of your html.

```html
<script src="browserReqs.min.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="browserReqs.css">
```
